# GRUMP-Workshop-2025
This repository contains a workbook which is intended to teach users basic R scripts which plot various data from the GRUMP dataset.

These scripts assume that you have downloaded R and R studio (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), and that you have the data downloaded and stored in your desktop in a folder called "GRUMP-Workshop" for which a template can be downloaded from this repository. The GRUMP data can be downloaded from simons CMAP: https://simonscmap.com/catalog/datasets/GRUMP.
